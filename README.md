# Face_mask_detection_system
Real-Time Face Mask Detector with Python, OpenCV, Keras ,numpy .

During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made wearing masks compulsory to protect against this deadly virus. In this project  we will develop a machine learning project â€“ Real-time Face Mask Detector with Python.
# In this project we are making an alert system .
+ We will build a real-time system to detect whether the person on the webcam is wearing a mask or not.. We will train the face mask detector model using Keras and OpenCV.
In this machine learning project for beginners,we will use Jupyter Notebook for the development .

## SUMMARY

In this project, we  have developed a deep learning model for face mask detection using Python, Keras, and OpenCV. We developed the face mask detector model for detecting whether person is wearing a mask or not and send a alert to the given e-mail. We have trained the model using Keras with network architecture. Training the model is the first part of this project and testing using webcam using OpenCV is the second part.

This is a nice project for beginners to implement their learnings and gain expertise .
