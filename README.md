# Face_mask_detection_system
Real-Time Face Mask Detector with Python, OpenCV, Keras

During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made wearing masks compulsory to protect against this deadly virus. In this project  we will develop a machine learning project â€“ Real-time Face Mask Detector with Python.
# In this project we are making an alert system .
We will build a real-time system to detect whether the person on the webcam is wearing a mask or not. We will train the face mask detector model using Keras and OpenCV.
In this machine learning project for beginners, we will use Jupyter Notebook for the development.
